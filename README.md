# NY Police Complaints Data Exploration
In this project I aim to explore this dataset and see if I can visualize any patterns within the data. I wanted to see if I could find any
patterns within the complaints.

Some of the questions which I try to answer include:

1. Is there a relationship between ethnicity and substantiated claims?
2. Are certain type of allegations more likely to be substantiated?
3. What is the average amount of complaints against a police officer?
4. How many officers were promoted despite having a complaint against them?

For example I visualize the amount of complaints per officer and how many officers fall into these bins.
